        <h2 class="use of humour">HUMOUR</h2>
        <p1 class="manu" > Trevor clearly brought out when he met his Zulu friends while walking on the street
            as they were planning to mug him and he surprised them by replying with their language (Zulu).  
           “Yo, guys,why don't we just mug someone together?” They looked shocked  and started laughing.
          This became a tool that served his whole life<br> by escaping many things that could have affected his life. His mother
          taught him all the languages in their country which made his life easier.
          Another instance is when he was in school at<br> H.A.Jack, he used to come late in school and used to be called
         among the kids with detention.One day the prefect was calling detentions for that week and he automatically  stood up and wasn't among them ,
         everyone burst out  laughing.”where is Trevor?” somebody yelled! “Nope”. The prefect  nodded.
         This also helped him to serve food early hence he used to  queue so long to buy food. </p>

        <h3 id="Abel" >ABEL s MARRIAGE</h3>
<p3 class="Abel">Trevor clearly displayed in the novel, in the last chapter:MY MOTHER S LIFE.
    I quote: "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife for a long time i wondered
      why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was opposite of that in every way
      if he wanted a woman to bow to him,there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that
     purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he
      never falls in love with subservient woman.He s attracted to independent woman. "He s like an exotic bird collector"
      , she said. "He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is put her in a cage. Also i realized that he used that
    statement ironically ,whereby, besides Abel wanted to marry a traditional wife he ended up marrying an modern woman. </p2>
