<p>I am a student,a sister and Last born in a family of nine siblings.Spaghetti is my favourite food My hobbies are watching news/video and sweeping especially my free times.
    Born in Wajir,Kenya  December 2000 at a constituency called Waberi(WAJIR, East).
    discovering new things. My dislikes are: when somebody talk ill about me of what i have not done at all.
    I grew up with both my parents and siblings, till I travelled to Nairobi for further studies .
     Immediately after school I got  an opportunity as a Junior news Anchor at our local radio station which destined me join AkiraChix,
     which is a Non_profit Organization , where Girls/WOMEN fulfill their dreams .
     Since i was young i used to love travelling abroad and soon my wish will get fulfilled.Furthermore , i am making sure that i prioritize my family
     and their wellbeing.
