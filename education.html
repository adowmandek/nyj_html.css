    <p> When I was 7 years old ,I was admitted to my first nursery school in Waberi primary school which is the only public school in our constituency.
        In 2015 i deed my KCPE, certificate of primary level.Also i finished my high school in 2019 at Wajir Girls Secondary School.
         Immediately after school I got  an opportunity as a Junior news Anchor at our local radio station which destined me join AkiraChix,</p>
         <p1> My educational experience includes a recently studying a college  which contributed greatly to my development of skills such as  teamwork.
         I noticed that the job posting listed these as essential skills for the position. The classes I took and projects I completed were for a marketing major- and
          they imparted many of the concepts necessary to understanding good sales techniques. I also often worked to complete presentations with classmates-
           and this helped me hone my ability to collaborate constructively. 
          My educational background has prepared me well for this position and for a successful career path. 
          I also plan to pursue further coursework in the future in order to keep learning and gain the qualifications to advance in this field.
